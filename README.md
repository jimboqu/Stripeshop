# Rails Stripe Store

This is a basic example of a store built on Ruby on Rails and integrated with Stripe for payment processing. 

The functionality allows the user to buy pictures on wind turbines, which are hosted on AWS.

Gems include Rails-Stripe, Active_Admin, and PG. 

## Things to do

Add in subscription, more products, and sort the design out. Although the basics are done to be honest. This is more about getting Stripe working than anything else.
